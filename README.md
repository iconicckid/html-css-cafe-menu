Project Idea: Modern Cafe Landing Page
Goal: Create a full landing page for the cafe that includes: ✅ A header with the cafe's name and a navigation menu.
✅ A hero section with a welcome message and a featured coffee image.
✅ A menu section (like your previous project, but improved with better spacing and hover effects).
✅ A testimonial section with customer reviews (using CSS styling for a card layout).
✅ A contact section with a form for reservations or inquiries.
